Banking Application: An OOP Implementation
This banking application is designed and developed using core Java principles, leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to model real-world banking entities and their interactions.

Core Features:-

Account Management:
    Create different account types (Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit) with distinct attributes and functionalities.
    Perform account opening, closing, and modification operations.
    Implement account search and retrieval functionalities.
Transaction Handling:
    Process deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
    Maintain transaction history with timestamps and descriptions.
    Implement balance inquiry and statement generation.
Customer Management:
    Create and manage customer profiles with personal information.
    Associate customers with multiple accounts.
    Implement customer authentication and authorization.
User Interface:
    Provide a user-friendly interface for account holders to perform banking operations.
    Implement error handling and validation for user input.
OOP Implementation
    The application effectively utilizes OOP concepts to enhance code organization, reusability, and maintainability:

Inheritance:
    Establishes a hierarchical relationship between different account types (Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit) inheriting common attributes  and methods from a base Account class.
Encapsulation:
    Protects account and customer data by encapsulating them within classes, providing controlled access through methods.
    Hides implementation details from external components.
Polymorphism:
    Enables different account types to be treated as generic Account objects, allowing for flexible and extensible code.
Abstraction:
    Focuses on essential features of banking entities, ignoring unnecessary implementation details.
    Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
